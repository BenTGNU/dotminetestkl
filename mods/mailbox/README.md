This repository is the continuation of everamzah's `mailbox` mod for Minetest.

It provides a modified xdecor mailbox, enhanced to be able to accept books-only as an option (blue box) or the default accept-anything (red box).

Releases are available [on the releases tab](https://github.com/taikedz/everamzah-mailbox/releases) (GitHub)
